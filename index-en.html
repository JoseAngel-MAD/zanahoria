            <p>A carrot doesn't want to be like a blueberry, a kiwi or a mango.</p>
            <p>A carrot does not care if the berries are cooler.</p>
            <p>A carrot wants to be a carrot.</p>
            <h2 class="zanahoria">Be like a carrot.</h2>
            <p>Don't try to be 'w','x','y' or 'z' or compare yourself to them.</p>
            <p>You are not them.</p>
            <p>You are you.</p>
            <p>A unique person.</p>    
            <p>There is no other person in the world like you.</p>    
            <p>Appreciate and love yourself as you are and your world will change forever.</p>
            <p>Accepting yourself as you are is the best gift you can give yourself.</p>    
            <h2 class="zanahoria">Be like a carrot.</h2>    
            <h2 class = 'posdata'>Postscript: </h2>    
            <p>Love and accept yourself but no matter what, don't become complacent.</p>
            <p>We can all improve in many ways and we can achieve it if we work on it.</p>    
            <p>Try to improve day by day and get closer to the image of yourself that you want to become.</p>    
            <p>And, in the meantime, love and accept yourself.</p>    
            <p>Always.</p>
